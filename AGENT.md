# AGENT.md - JavaScript O'Reilly Learning Repository

## Build/Test Commands
- No build system or package.json - run HTML files directly in browser
- To test: Open `index.html` files in browser or use Live Server extension
- No automated tests - this is a learning repository with standalone examples

## Architecture & Structure
- Educational JavaScript repository organized in 4 sections: I-1/ through IV-4/
- Each lesson folder contains: `index.html`, `Script.js`, and sometimes `style.css`
- No external dependencies or frameworks - pure vanilla JavaScript
- Topics range from basic console operations to execution contexts and scope

## Code Style & Conventions
- Files use mixed case naming: `Script.js` (not `script.js`)
- HTML links to JavaScript as `./script.js` (lowercase in HTML)
- JavaScript uses modern ES6+ features (const, arrow functions, destructuring)
- Console logging for output and debugging throughout examples
- French language comments and alerts mixed with English
- No strict formatting rules - educational code with learning comments
- Variables use camelCase: `persom`, `arr`
- No type checking or linting configured

## Running Examples
- Open any `index.html` file in a web browser
- Use browser DevTools console to see JavaScript output
- No server required - all examples run client-side
